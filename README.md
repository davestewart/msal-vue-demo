# Overview

This fork of is a non-typescript implementation of Dave Stewart's msal-vue-demo.

# Differences

The obvious difference is that it doesn't use TypeScript. I didn't like to learn TypeScript so I made it work without it.

Another difference is that this version implements 2 components. One of which is using Chart JS / Vue Chart JS.
Also, I have an express.js backend that I'm not ready to publish yet. Instead of the "User" page we have a "Dashboard" page here.
With my express.js backend I query our productive Autotask REST API. 
The good news is that I provided some sample data to display something.

# Thanks
